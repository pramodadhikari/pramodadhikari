Hi, I’m Pramod Adhikari. I am an Atmospheric Science researcher with a Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science. My research focuses on the regional aspects of climate change over the Himalayan region using satellite-based observational, reanalysis, and numerical modeling. My Ph.D. research emphasized understanding the role of aerosols in modulating the regional precipitation, cloud properties, and elevation-dependent precipitation and surface temperature distribution over the central Himalayas, which are crucial for the regional hydroclimate. I have a broad interest in understanding the impact of changing climate on the regional and local levels.
